This three-day fest guarantees a wholesome journey through time as we explore the evolution of our diverse art, music and dance culture over the years. <br /><br />It's time to pause our busy schedules and dive into the good vibes of Cultrang'23! Let's hit the play button and indulge in the present moment of celebration. With all the mesmerising cultural richness from the recent past few decades, CultRang'23 would leave no stone unturned in helping us rewind – and switch to the vivid time zones of traditional art forms and timeless film classics through the multitude of opportunities presented here. This way, we may begin to appreciate how these works of art have evolved and mixed with international colour to give us the uniquely globalised style that is so in vogue today.</div>
